Exoplanets

Dataset: NASA Exoplanet Archive (public online).
This dataset lists all the planets that have been discovered outside our solar system. 
It includes each planet’s size, distance from its star, and other details. 
I can use it to make graphs that compare planet size or orbit distance.

Climate Change / Air Quality

Tool: OpenAQ API (global air-quality data).

Summary: This site collects real air-quality data from many countries. 
It has information on air pollutants. 
I could use it to see which cities have cleaner or dirtier air, or how pollution changes over time.

Probability and Statistics

Dataset: Pokémon TCG All Cards 1999–2023 (from Kaggle).
This dataset includes almost every Pokémon card with details like name, type, rarity, HP, and release year. 
I can use it to see how cards have changed over time, which types have the highest HP, or which sets have the rarest cards.

I chose Pokémon cards because I love collecting them, and I think it would be really fun to turn that into a data project. 
I could use Python to find patterns in card stats or make visual charts about rarity and value.

3.
Lists and dictionaries to store Pokémon cards and their stats
Loops (for loops) to go through all the cards
Conditionals (if statements) to check things like if a card is rare or common
Functions to organize my code and do things like calculate averages
pandas to make it easier to sort and filter card data
matplotlib to make bar charts and scatter plots
GitHub to save my work and keep track of versions
